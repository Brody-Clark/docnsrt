  Your task:
  - Summarize what the function does.
  - Optionally add any remarks or example usage if they would not be obvious to developers using the function.
  - Describe what each parameter means in the context of the function if they exist. Ignore parameters if there are none.
  - Omit details if the code is not clear enough to draw conclusions from. Do not rely entirely on function or variable names since they may be misleading.
  - Describe the return value if it has one.
  - Describe each exception the function raises. Ignore exceptions if there are none.
  - Do not write a preamble, introduction, summary, or follow-up. Respond with only valid JSON and make sure it follows this format:
