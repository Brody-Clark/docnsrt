# prompt_template: |
# This file defines the default prompt template used by Docmancer to instruct the LLM
# on how to generate function documentation. The template supports Python's str.format()
# placeholders (e.g., {signature}, {body}, {qualified_name}, etc.), which will be dynamically
# replaced at runtime with information about the function being documented.
#
# To customize the prompt, you may edit the instructions, add or remove formatting, or
# include/exclude placeholders as needed. Make sure to keep the placeholders wrapped in
# curly braces so they can be replaced by Docmancer.
#
# Available placeholders include:
#   {signature}           - The function signature
#   {preceding_comments}  - Any comments immediately above the function
#   {qualified_name}      - The fully qualified function name
#   {body}                - The function's source code body
#   {expected_json_format}- The required JSON output format for the LLM
#
# Save this file after editing. Docmancer will use your custom prompt for all LLM requests.

  Your task:
  - Summarize what the function does.
  - Optionally add any remarks or example usage if they would not be obvious to developers using the function.
  - Describe what each parameter means in the context of the function if they exist. Ignore parameters if there are none.
  - Omit details if the code is not clear enough to draw conclusions from. Do not rely entirely on function or variable names since they may be misleading.
  - Describe the return value if it has one.
  - Describe each exception the function raises. Ignore exceptions if there are none.
  - Do not write a preamble, introduction, summary, or follow-up. Respond with only valid JSON and make sure it follows this format:
  {expected_json_format}
